    <summary>The .NET Framework is a development platform for building apps for web, Windows, Windows Phone, Windows Server, and Microsoft Azure.</summary>
    <description>The .NET Framework is a development platform for building apps for web, Windows, Windows Phone, Windows Server, and Microsoft Azure. It consists of the common language runtime (CLR) and the .NET Framework class library, which includes a broad range of functionality and support for many industry standards.

The .NET Framework provides many services, including memory management, type and memory safety, security, networking, and application deployment. It provides easy-to-use data structures and APIs that abstract the lower-level Windows operating system. You can use a variety of programming languages with the .NET Framework, including C#, F#, and Visual Basic.

Supported Windows Client versions: Windows 11 version 21H2, Windows 10 version 22H2, Windows 10 version 21H2, Windows 10 version 21H1, Windows 10 version 20H2

Supported Windows Server versions: Windows Server 2022

.NET Framework 4.8.1 is preinstalled with the operating system starting from Windows 11 version 22H2 and Windows Server 2025. On these systems, this package installs successfully, but does nothing.

The matching Developer Pack can be installed using [this package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/netfx-4.8.1-devpack).

**This package is intended to be used by package maintainers as a dependency.** For end users the [dotnetfx](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dotnetfx) package is recommended, because it provides an easy way to upgrade the .NET Framework to a future release using standard Chocolatey mechanisms.

On systems which have a newer version of the .NET Framework installed, this package installs successfully, but does nothing.
