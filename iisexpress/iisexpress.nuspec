    <description>Internet Information Services (IIS) 10.0 Express is a free, simple and self-contained version of IIS that is optimized for developers.

The benefits of using IIS 10.0 Express include: 
- The same web server that runs on your production server is now available on your development computer. 
- Most tasks can be done without the need for administrative privileges.
- IIS Express runs on Windows 7 Service Pack 1 and all later versions of Windows.
